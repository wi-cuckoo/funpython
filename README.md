# funpython
This repository contains something little tool writed by C, for personal interests. And every file can be compiled into a executable software. In 2016/3/13, I rename the repo with funpython, that means I would like to write some fun application using **python** and put them there. As for software written before, I collected them into the file *file_in_C*.

## file_in_C
this part is about some operations of file, including creating, reading, and write. It sounds like `cat` command. But I don't know the original code of `cat` (though I can find it), it was coded by myself and for learning.

## Daily Poem
I wrotten a *dailypeom.py* with the help of *py-term* lib. The lib can be used to print colorful and multi-style text in cmd-line. So this application will show a random peom with a random color every time when you open a new fake terminal(run this py in login shell). All peoms is stored as tuple data. If you want to add more, you can re-edit source code, and put peoms data in a single text file. That will be fine.
